It will be on exhibit 7/23 - 7/31 in Awagin Hall.  DFK needed to be modded for unmanned operation.  Hikaru made a nice icon indicating the audience to hit the clappers (2 planks of wood hit each other to produce loud high clapping sounds).  He also assisted me by typing what I said.  Takeshi showed up later and discussed schedule, etc. <span class="time">09:45</span></p><p>WORK:  7/15 Uemasa 8-5 w/ double Masahiros <span class="time">09:37</span></p></article><article id="d2022-07-14"><H3><a href="#d2022-07-14">2022-07-14</a></H3><p>Went to seikotsu-in 11am - 1pm. <span class="time">00:23</span></p><p>At night, checked out the vegetable garden behind the elementary school.

We took a glance at masaka's excellent website about HTML basics (<a href="https://www.kanzaki.com/docs/htminfo.html">ごく簡単なHTMLの説明</a>).
