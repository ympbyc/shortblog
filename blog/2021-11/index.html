I woke up at 4. Cooked breakfast on the wood burning stove.  I ate 2 pieces of walnut bread, a piece of apple pie, white + brown mix rice, and a bowl of misoshiru.  Cycled to polytech.  At lunchtime, I tried to catch chinu w/ a harpoon 銛 but the fish didn't come near.  Couple of vietnamese guys came to check out the fish in the water. I also found a student fishing in the bush. TIG welding 2mm stainless steel. <span class="time">06:23</span></p><p>10/31 Went to adopt w/ sea and sky and picked up trash on the road. We played outside afterward. S baked an apple pie for my birthday while we were away.  I felt exhausted and had to come home to lay down.  Sky was crying downstairs because she wants to eat the pie.  I waited until she slept.  Three of us who don't cry ate the pie. Sky can eat it later.  S drove us to Jurobe Yashiki for Ningyo Joruri モチモチの木.  We met daifuku, manami, and akari. <span class="time">06:18</span></p><p>10/30 Sea went to TOEC.  The rest of us went to the harbour and ate fish tempura. Then we fished and caught baby red snappers.  THe old fisherman we met told us baby snappers are called &quot;charinko&quot;. <span class="time">06:18</span></p></article><div><a href="../index.html">-&gt;INDEX</a></div><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine</footer></body></html>
