Thay played and played.  Sky climed to the top of the multi-level slide with my assist but she couldn't make up her mind to slide for a long time.  There was a boy at the top of the slide who also was hesitating to slide.  His mom yelling the boy.  He gives up and climed down the ladder and his mom was furious.  He walked away in tears and sat by the flowers.  I sat near him with Sky and spoke a few words to him to comfort him. Sea took us to the bridge on the pond where there are many kois. Sky and I went back to make sure the boy was OK.  Sky followed soon after and Sea and Sky started playing in the sand pit.  He was in the sand pit w/ his mon and lil sista.  His mom still murmuring to him.  At one point the boy started crying so I jumped in to the sand pit and sat by Sea and Sky where it was also near them.  I did not say anything. I just listened and tried to make them notice I was listening.  The mother kept askng the boy why he didn't slide.  The boy told the mother he was feeling cold and the mother said she told him to wear a jacket.  Then they left.  The boy helped the mother pick up the shovels and buckets. They washed hands and the mother handed the boy a hand towel then a bottle of tea. They walked away. Sea met her friend from kindergarden at last and she seemed so happy.   <span class="time">05:03</span></p><p>11/20 At lunchtime I was talking to the guy.  He comes to polytech on his ordinary bicycle. He told me he owns a car that's 25 years old.  The girl came and spoke to us for a short while. S came with kids to pick me up at polytech. <span class="time">04:46</span></p><p>11/19 Polytech welding.  I met with a employment counseller about a job at a welding factory. I told her to give me until Monday to decide if she calls the factory. At lunch I ate by the river near the sea as always.  A girl came and spoke to me about fishing.  Then the guy I met yesterday came and we talked. S came to pick me up at our liquor. <span class="time">04:43</span></p><p>11/18 At polytech I spoke to the InI who used to be the owner of a naturlist food shop.

I woke up at 4. Cooked breakfast on the wood burning stove.  I ate 2 pieces of walnut bread, a piece of apple pie, white + brown mix rice, and a bowl of misoshiru.  Cycled to polytech.  At lunchtime, I tried to catch chinu w/ a harpoon 銛 but the fish didn't come near.  Couple of vietnamese guys came to check out the fish in the water. I also found a student fishing in the bush.

S baked an apple pie for my birthday while we were away.  I felt exhausted and had to come home to lay down.  Sky was crying downstairs because she wants to eat the pie.  I waited until she slept.  Three of us who don't cry ate the pie. Sky can eat it later.  S drove us to Jurobe Yashiki for Ningyo Joruri モチモチの木.
