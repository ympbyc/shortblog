We went to meet Izume family.  They lived in New Zealand for the past 4 years and came back a few month ago.  They shared with us their experience in NZ.  The kids were very friendly and played with Sea and Sky despite their difference in age.  I carelessly ate the cake Satoco baked with rice flour and by the time we got left their house the allergy was kicking in.  It got worse as time went by.  By the time we got home I was so nauseous and it was difficult to maintain conciousness.  I retired to upstairs and looked at my phone.  There was an email from my dad telling me that my grand mother just passed away.  I meditated for a while then slept.  I woke up and Sea wants to go ride her bike so I walked behind her to the playground.  I was stilll nauseous and we had to come home in 10 minutes.  I then took a walk to maruike shop and bought crackers, boiled bread, and karinto.  I spoke to the grandma there.  She told me of the old days when we had to make our own food and stock it for a year in case of low harvest.  She's not happy about contemporary way of buying food double or tripe wrapped in plastic.  Me, too.  At home I cut open two old car tires and made planters.  I continued cutting the trees in the jungle. <span class="time">22:18</span></p><p>5/7 In the morning we went to a cafe and had breakfast.  I drank 3 cups of coffee in a short time and that made me agitated.  We then went to farmer's market to buy some water melon sprouts.  We came home and Sea, Sky and I went to the river cand caught a lot of small jinta fish.  Later I started cutting into the jungle by our house.  The place apparently belong to nobody and so there's noone to take care of the trees and they grew so tall and bushy.  The neighbor on the other side of the jungle noticed and welcomed the change.  At night Issei gave me a ride to a campfire by the river.  I met the headmaster of an international school in the city for the first time.  His  son was also there.  His wife appeared, had short conversation and went back.  They are close friend of Onomichi-san.  We talked about many things.  Chemtrails, American politics, stock exchange, alteernative shools, etc.  We were up until 1am. <span class="time">22:00</span></p></article><article id="d2022-05-06"><H2><a href="#d2022-05-06">2022-05-06</a></H2><p>5/4 Juggling workshop in Satoyama-daichi.

He  says no-one except Ryo has signed up for the juggling lesson. <span class="time">21:24</span></p><p>Satoco brought her laptop for repair. She is worried the repairman might steel her credentials.  She said she gave the password.  I promised to come with her and talk to the guy at the shop. <span class="time">21:23</span></p><p>Drinking 紅茶- red tea now. <span class="time">21:21</span></p><p>I been feeling depressed for a week or two.  I been feeling ill in my stomach and my gut and that make me don't want to move.  I just did not feel like talking to anyone especially on the phone + IMs.  Last night I remembered about St. Johns wort.  I brew a cup of SJW (hypericum perforatum) tea and drank.  10 or so minutes later I felt a sudden shift of mood and I felt like I'm functioning.  The power of this herb can't be underestimated.  I bought dried herb off 生活の木 a few years ago.  I think it's getting more and more potent as years go by or my physiology is changing. <span class="time">21:20</span></p><p>カボチャの畝を作った。 <span class="time">21:08</span></p><p>米アレルギー確定。今日保育中、弁当を食べた後、例の気分が悪くなり体が動かなくなる現象が再発。2日ほど米を抜いている間は出ていなかった。油で炒めた飯は少量なら大丈夫な模様。 <span class="time">21:08</span></p><p>JUGGLING:  焦らない。チャンスは一度。演技中一度止まって落ち着く。帽子は大事。音楽決めておく。 <span class="time">21:05</span></p><p>5/1 Juggling at the Beer market.  I arrived around noon and asked sayaka if I could juggle on the street between the brewary and the car pool.  She said do it here in front of the crowd.  So I asked DJ Fuji-kun to play some roots reggae vinil he brought and juggled to the music.  I did 3, 4, and 5 balls + some poi.  I didn't think ahead what I was going to do.  I kind of rushed and ran out of tricks but I had to juggle on because the music was still playing.  I vanished at last and that wasn't cool.  The crowd was kind enough to put some coins to my cap on the ground while I was away fetching the flyers.  I shall pause once and calm down next time.  Also I need to think how I end. <span class="time">21:02</span></p></article><div><a href="../index.html">-&gt;INDEX</a></div><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine written in Common Lisp.</footer></body></html>
