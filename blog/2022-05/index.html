He  says no-one except Ryo has signed up for the juggling lesson. <span class="time">21:24</span></p><p>Satoco brought her laptop for repair. She is worried the repairman might steel her credentials.  She said she gave the password.  I promised to come with her and talk to the guy at the shop. <span class="time">21:23</span></p><p>Drinking 紅茶- red tea now. <span class="time">21:21</span></p><p>I been feeling depressed for a week or two.  I been feeling ill in my stomach and my gut and that make me don't want to move.  I just did not feel like talking to anyone especially on the phone + IMs.  Last night I remembered about St. Johns wort.  I brew a cup of SJW (hypericum perforatum) tea and drank.  10 or so minutes later I felt a sudden shift of mood and I felt like I'm functioning.  The power of this herb can't be underestimated.  I bought dried herb off 生活の木 a few years ago.  I think it's getting more and more potent as years go by or my physiology is changing. <span class="time">21:20</span></p><p>カボチャの畝を作った。 <span class="time">21:08</span></p><p>米アレルギー確定。今日保育中、弁当を食べた後、例の気分が悪くなり体が動かなくなる現象が再発。2日ほど米を抜いている間は出ていなかった。油で炒めた飯は少量なら大丈夫な模様。 <span class="time">21:08</span></p><p>JUGGLING:  焦らない。チャンスは一度。演技中一度止まって落ち着く。帽子は大事。音楽決めておく。 <span class="time">21:05</span></p><p>5/1 Juggling at the Beer market.  I arrived around noon and asked sayaka if I could juggle on the street between the brewary and the car pool.  She said do it here in front of the crowd.  So I asked DJ Fuji-kun to play some roots reggae vinil he brought and juggled to the music.  I did 3, 4, and 5 balls + some poi.  I didn't think ahead what I was going to do.  I kind of rushed and ran out of tricks but I had to juggle on because the music was still playing.  I vanished at last and that wasn't cool.  The crowd was kind enough to put some coins to my cap on the ground while I was away fetching the flyers.  I shall pause once and calm down next time.  Also I need to think how I end. <span class="time">21:02</span></p></article><div><a href="../index.html">-&gt;INDEX</a></div><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine written in Common Lisp.</footer></body></html>
