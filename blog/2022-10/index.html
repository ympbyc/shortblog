I had to go to nekko-bokko with sea.  I put up a big tipi tent in the field.  In the evening it was raining.  I went to search the kitten in the hill.  Satoco heared the kitten cry and she was found in the burn next next door. <span class="time">00:46</span></p><p>10/25 I went to convini on the red bike to print out a form for requesting retrieval of my account for domain management. On the way back in the tunnel on top of the hill, I was riding onthe very narrow sidewalk in the dark tunnel and suddenly there was a small white ball of fur with eyes gazing at me.  It was a small kitten with her left leg broken.  She was terrified of the cars speeding by.  She didn't want me to catch her and tried to get away but I managed to pick her up and carry home.  At home the kitten kept hiding in the corner behind something.  She went underneath the washing machine and went inside.  I had to half dissasemble the washing machine before she came out.  Satoco took her to the vet in the afternoon and reserved for operation on Nov 1st. <span class="time">00:44</span></p><p>10/19  When I was weeding in the farm I spotted an ohenro-san sitting on a bench in front of the public restroom.  Andrea was his name.  He came from a small village in the mountains called Limonette.  He said his feet were hurting and he was considering to camp in front of the restroom.  I invited him to camp in the garden and he came.  Satoco came home with kids and we all ate dinner Satoco had prepared which was oden.  Andrea knew a lot about Japanese cuisine.  He is fresh out of university.  Limonette is situated very near the border between Italy and France.  In the village there is a community oven where residents take turn baking bread for the whole winter.  He set up his tent in (what I call) the wood deck and slept in there.  In the morning we ate breakfast together.  We exchanged email addresses, and took photos and he set off.  He must still be walking as of today. <span class="time">00:34</span></p><p>10/16 In the afternoon Keita and Mayui came and we dug up some sweet potatoes out of the farm behind the elementary school.  Later, Kanon, Rio, and Issei joined and we went to see the chickens. <span class="time">00:21</span></p><p>10/16 Sunday.  Cindy was found dead underneath the neighbors engawa.  Cindy had something stuffed in her mouth.  Her body was already stiff and the mouth didn't open however hard I tried.  We assume she suffocated to death while eating her pray.  We dug a hole in the garden and let Cindy lay in there.  Tsuru and the kids came to pay tribute. <span class="time">00:19</span></p><p>10/15 4 of us ate crapes. Then Satoco went to Bourangerie for work.  3 of us went to the park with a big pond and played for 3 hours before coming home.  Cindy the cat didn't come home this night and the night before and Satoco was worried. <span class="time">00:15</span></p><p>10/13  Sky says she doesn't want to go to hoiku-sho.  Sky, sea and I went to mayucove's rice field and helped Masato harvest rice a little bit.  Kumi-san, Soyo, and Chiquita were also there.  Satoco joined later and we all let kids play in the kitchen garden. After we came home. I messaged C and told I want to have a tea-time with you. It felt as if a huge needle stuck deep inside me was finally pulled out. <span class="time">00:12</span></p><p>10/11 Satoco's parents and family of Satoco's older sister came and stayed w/ us overnight.  We went out to eat at a Chinese restaurant.  The next day I stayed home while everybody else went to an aquarium. <span class="time">00:08</span></p><p>9/28 - 10/4 Okinawa.  Swam in the sea, fishing, staying at a guest house with 3 of us (Sea, Sky, and I) while Satoco went to yoga retreat.  Met Yoko-san, Sanae-san, Aya-san and her husband, Mikana-chan's mother.  Last night in Naha we went to Ne-ne-s live. <span class="time">00:07</span></p></article><div><a href="../index.html">-&gt;INDEX</a></div><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine written in Common Lisp.</footer></body></html>
