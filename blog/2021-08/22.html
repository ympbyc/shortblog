In the afternoon I took MAOI and rode the bike with sea and sky in the trailer. After an hour of pedaling we arrive at hanamaru udon. We ate 温玉ぶっかけ, 磯辺揚げ, 厚揚げ, 煮玉子. Then we went to a little park w/ a slide and swings but the rain started dropping. So I parked the bicycle and the trailer under a roof and we went inside the building next to the little park. Inside we found the library. We spend roughly 30 mins in the library reading picture books. As the rain drops became very sparse, we rode to the park w/ a pond. Sea played w/ Anzu a girl she just met.  At about 6PM we left the park and I pushed the bike+trailer+kids up the mountain to come home.  S came home from work before us.  S cooked ゴーヤチャンプルー and 大葉genovese macaroni.  <span class="time">23:16</span></p><img src="thumbs/IMGP0033-2021-08-22-22-45.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-08-22"><img src="thumbs/IMGP0031-2021-08-22-22-45.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-08-22"></article><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine written in Common Lisp.</footer></body></html>
