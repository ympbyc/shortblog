He said I need to get vaccinated.  I researched about the Austrian border policy and found that PCR is sufficient.  Benoit emailed me that the producer won't allow for non-vaccinated.  I don't know if I'm making a wise decision not to get the new vaccine or I'm just being lazy.  I think I wanted more discussion. <span class="time">14:14</span></p><img src="thumbs/IMGP0043-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0042-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0040-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0039-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0038-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0036-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0035-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0033-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0031-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0030-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0027-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0026-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0023-2021-12-11-14-00.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0020-2021-12-11-13-59.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><img src="thumbs/IMGP0019-2021-12-11-13-59.JPG " width="320" alt="2021-12-11"/><p>I've read the house contract and found that it is setup to renew automatically. phew.

We baked cookies and 4 girls made slimes.  Issei shared with us his encounter with aliens and UFOs.  One day he met a man who says 'I'm an alien'. The alien invited Issei for lunch. The alien said he is vegan and he makes gestures on the food served in order to up the vibration.  Then they went outside. The alien points his finger at the sky and told issei to look abd he range light moving about.  Then the alien points to a different spot in the sky where there was another strange point of light moving strangely.  He had no choice but to believe in what the alien was claiming.  At night Kta gave me a call.  His neighbor caught a lot of tsubasu fish and I can come and get some.  I went to Kta house after dinner and dissected two fish with Kta's help and brought those home. <span class="time">21:24</span></p><p>12/4 モノの循環市 in wakimachi.

Coco goes to glass bead workshop. I drove her to the train station near the library.   I took sky to the music play at Komiko.  Sky was tired from hard play last night.  I spoke to nabe-chan.  I want to live near this beach.  We picked up coco at the central station and head home. We bought coffee beans, pizza, and sake in a deep-blue bottole on the way.  Sea came home.  She told coco no playing outside today.  I decided tomove the wooden slide I made downstairs. It was a hard work but I did it.  I prepared cookie dough because we are going to use the oven for pizza. We baked pizza then cookies.  The dinner was left over soup from yesterday, pizza, and cookies. Sky contracted a fever and went to futon early.  Sky and I painted the slide together.  Then we drew sketches of birds before going to futon.  <span class="time">09:26</span></p><p>11/29 Invited local friends over for okonomiyaki.
