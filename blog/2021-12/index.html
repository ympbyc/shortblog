Coco goes to glass bead workshop. I drove her to the train station near the library.   I took sky to the music play at Komiko.  Sky was tired from hard play last night.  I spoke to nabe-chan.  I want to live near this beach.  We picked up coco at the central station and head home. We bought coffee beans, pizza, and sake in a deep-blue bottole on the way.  Sea came home.  She told coco no playing outside today.  I decided tomove the wooden slide I made downstairs. It was a hard work but I did it.  I prepared cookie dough because we are going to use the oven for pizza. We baked pizza then cookies.  The dinner was left over soup from yesterday, pizza, and cookies. Sky contracted a fever and went to futon early.  Sky and I painted the slide together.  Then we drew sketches of birds before going to futon.  <span class="time">09:26</span></p><p>11/29 Invited local friends over for okonomiyaki.
