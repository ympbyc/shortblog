Then I rode my bike to hana-anzu to see Bico's paintings.  The paintings did have some resemblance to what I have seen when I ingested pharmahuasca.  I was amazed by his talent.  I drank a cup of maccha.  It was a good time.  PM maya came and we chatted.  At night I continued working on the website I was ordered to make. <span class="time">17:08</span></p></article><article id="d2022-11-13"><H3><a href="#d2022-11-13">2022-11-13</a></H3><p>11/12 Sea, Sky and I went to Sadamitsu-Ku-Ichi by train.  At Anabuki station, I called Daifuku.  He and akari was close by and able to pick us up by his car.  I had alot of fun.  The band Dokozono-darezo was good.  I juggled a little, too.  Met a rasta from Gifu who sells candles.  Daifuku took us to the station.  Lots of love all around. <span class="time">13:52</span></p><p><b> 11/11 For the past few weeks I've been trouble by my allergy reaction the mixture of air I breathe.  So I went to a Chinese medicine clinic but it was closed!  So I instead went to a hardware store and bought gasoline tank, chainsaw-oil, and 50:1 mix gasoline.  When I went outside to the huge expance of the parking lot, the sun olready set a few minutes ago.  The sky was in a gradation between orange and dark cyan.  Up above my shaven head was just sky.  Then a thought struck me.  &quot;What is the nature that's always with me even when I'm in a building in a city?&quot;.  Much like how a mountain is a mix of earth, rocks, trees, grass, fungas, mushrooms, insects, bugs, snails, mammals, reptiles, etc, the air we breathe is also a diverse mixture of gas, pollen, spores of mold, virus, dust, etc.  Yoga pranayama teaches us to breathe in the good clean energy, fill the body up with it. Then breathe out all the dark feelings.  However it is also written in yoga texts that a yogi shall live alone in a clean place without disturbances like in a mountain or something.  So the context in which we practice yoga is very much different.  We practice yoga in this industrial age with cars burping out toxic gas. Then the mindset about breathing I think needs to be reversed.  We shall &quot;breathe in the bad things, believe in the body's ability to purify, and breathe out good things&quot;.  Yui is a word that describe how every living being contributing to the cycle of life and death to sustain the equilibrium.  Now the equilibrium is clearly broken because humans exploit all the good things out of nature and trashing out bad things.  The process needs to be reversed and it starts with reversing our mindset about breathing.  Lotus flower bloom in a muddy water.  My allergy went away. </b><span class="time">13:47</span></p><p>11/11  Nekkobokko.  I brought ingredients for miso soup in a tapper (satoimo, komatsuna, miso, niboshi-ko) and cook it for lunch so everyone can share.  I drew sketches in kids' notebook which is used for communication between staff and parents.  In Kensho's notebook I drew a perspective scene of corridor with windows from which outside scenery can be seen.  In Kiho's notebook I drew the tree kids like to climb onto using a wooden ladder.  On the tree was Sea reading a book and on the ground by the ladder, Kiho was reading a book.  On Jinsei's notebook I drew a quick sketch of him.  All drawings were colored with color pencils. <span class="time">13:06</span></p><p>11/10 PM Zach from America came with the translator Tatsuo to Orono.  Takeshi and I met him in Orono fusuma storage.  Zach originally came to Japan to study karakuri ningyo but upon encountering fusumakarakuri, he got fascinated and his research now focus on fusumakarakuri.  We talked and talked and it was a good time. <span class="time">12:57</span></p><img src="thumbs/chainsaw-note-1-2022-11-13-12-53.png " width="320" alt="2022-11-13"/><img src="thumbs/chainsaw-note-0-2022-11-13-12-53.png " width="320" alt="2022-11-13"/><p>11/10 AM chainsaw lecture + dissassembly and maintenance.  <span class="time">12:52</span></p></article><article id="d2022-11-04"><H3><a href="#d2022-11-04">2022-11-04</a></H3><p>11/4 I went to kamata-san's to see his chainsaw.  I called yosuke to ask about his chainsaw.  Yosuke said he can give me some fresh deer meat he dissected yesterday. I went to his house to pick up 5 bags full of meat and liver.  I got home and cooked the liver.  It taste like placenta and delicious.  Later sea went to some kind of festival w/ her friend at the kindergarden.
