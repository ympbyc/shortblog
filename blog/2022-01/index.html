I ate もち, 雑煮, and ぶり大根 for lunch.　Cabling material was low on stock so I drove to home center in next town to buy it.  I bought materials and tools I will list separately.  I tried to pay with a credit card but it got rejected.  I ran to the ATM in a convinience store nearby and got money off the bank and got back to the store.  The lady at the cashier helped me carry the things I bought.  She asked questions about me.  It was warming conversing.  I noticed I was high probably from the cbn isolate dissolved into cbd oil + カナムグラ japanese-hop tea I took in the morning + coffee + running.  Feeling of gratitude toward life.  I came home and went for a walk with cindy the cat. At night I sealed the large window on the door in the kitchen with the polycarbonate board for insulation.  I ate くまごろう bread and ぶり大根鍋 for dinner. </span><span class="time">22:03</span></p><p>1/2 Visited the tomb of aunt in law who passed away last year.
