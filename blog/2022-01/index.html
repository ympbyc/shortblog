Ate お汁粉 with もち for breakfast.  I carried out my day according to the plan I made last night.  First I tried to open an account for stock exchange but it had to be put on hold.  Second, I ordered tactile switches needed to fix Jizo's sampling machine.  Next I washed cloth, myself in the bath, and dishes.  Next Mio's leaking 湯たんぽ hot water tank for warmth got soldered w/ the solder and the iron I bought yesterday. An email was sent. Then I climbed on the roof to fix a small 12V solar panel in place.  I bent a pair of aluminium strip I picked up in the polytech trash bin, insert one ends to the roof and the panel latches on to the other ends.  I lay the wire and started experimenting with lighting options.  TODO: make a simple 100V inverter.  I ate もち, 雑煮, and ぶり大根 for lunch.　Cabling material was low on stock so I drove to home center in next town to buy it.  I bought: 2x 10m enamel wire,  2x 3m 100Φ aluminium duct,  A door size polycarbonate board, strong scissors,  a tinned hard biscuit, a PET bottle lantern, a たわし tawashi for dish-washing, an ear-muff, a LED light bulb w/ movement sensor, a 3.2Φ drill bit, and a cable cover.  I tried to pay with a credit card but it got rejected.  I ran to the ATM in a convinience store nearby and got money off the bank and got back to the store.  The lady at the cashier helped me carry the things I bought.  She asked questions about me.  It was warming conversing.  I noticed I was high probably from the cbn isolate dissolved into cbd oil + カナムグラ japanese-hop tea I took in the morning + coffee + running.  I came home and went for a walk with cindy the cat. At night I sealed the large window on the door in the kitchen with the polycarbonate board for insulation.  I ate くまごろう bread and ぶり大根鍋 for dinner. <span class="time">22:03</span></p><p>1/2 Visited the tomb of aunt in law who passed away last year.  Then Yacchan let me pack her おせち osechi for me to take home.  I left Osaka at 11 and train -&gt; ferry -&gt; car -&gt; home.  I ate the おせち on the ferry.  里芋、こんにゃく、にんじん、百合根、ごぼう、昆布巻き、えび、いくら、鶏肉、栗きんとん、黒豆.  All very soft and gentle for the stomach.  It tasted delicious. <span class="time">21:21</span></p><p>1/1 We went to Osaka by ferry and train.  I didn't eat a thing for the stomach. <span class="time">21:16</span></p></article><div><a href="../index.html">-&gt;INDEX</a></div><footer>NORIFIX diary is powered by <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/shortblog">SHORTBLOG</a> a tiny CLI blog engine</footer></body></html>
